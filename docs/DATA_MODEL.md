# Data model

Status: conceptual inventory only. PostgreSQL and Drizzle selected under technical delegation; no tables, migration or final relationships implemented. See TECH_STACK.md.

## Candidate domains

| Domain | Candidate records from the brief |
| --- | --- |
| Identity and consent | User, SubjectProfile, SubjectClaim, SubjectVerification |
| Markets/accounting | Market, MarketOutcome, Position, Trade, Wallet, PlayMoneyTransaction, MarketPriceHistory |
| Information | InformationUpdate, Evidence, VerificationSource |
| Social/moderation | Follow, Comment, Report, Notification, AdminAction, AuditLog |
| Discovery/measurement | FeedImpression, RecommendationEvent, AlgorithmVersion, Experiment, ExperimentAssignment |

This list is not a commitment to one table per name or to implementing every entity in V1.

## Required boundaries

- Monetary records, evidence review and feed exposure need distinguishable ownership and audit trails.
- Identity, claim truth and market resolution must not be collapsed into one verification flag.
- A wallet balance alone cannot be the complete record of play-money activity.
- A mutable market wording field alone cannot establish which terms traders accepted.
- Raw evidence storage/access must be separate from the public claim presentation.
- Event time, observation time, review time and resolution time have distinct meanings.
- Deletion/retention policy must be settled before defining supposedly immutable personal-data records.

## Invariants to implement after policy agreement

- Referential integrity links records to their subjects, markets, owners, sources and actors.
- Accounting operations are atomic, idempotent and reproducible.
- Allowed state transitions and actor permissions are explicit.
- Corrections retain attributable history according to agreed retention rules.
- Feed responses and real impressions can be associated with the right algorithm/configuration.
- Sensitive content is excluded from analytics by design.

## Schema blockers

The owner has confirmed initial market-selection authority and wants an eventual AI reviewer that learns from their decisions. A candidate review record would preserve the case information available at decision time, the human decision/reason, any AI suggestion and its version, and later corrections. Exact fields, evidence retention, evaluation access and automation scope remain undecided; do not create a training-data pipeline or copy private evidence by default.

Decided enough to model (2026-09-15): subject-created goal proposals with owner approval and an owner-set opening price, where the subject's creation is the consent; exclusion of subjects and outcome decision-makers from trading, which implies storing who decides each market's outcome; trading against an app-run binary LMSR market maker with a stored liquidity parameter and share counts; positions carrying an average-cost basis per side for the 100-point per-market limit; and refill records timestamped well enough to count two per Eastern calendar month. Accounts are gated to Ohio State email addresses at launch. Still blocking their parts of the schema: binary/multi-outcome scope, economy settings, collusion controls, withdrawal, evidence access, verification workflow, cancellation accounting, reputation observations, AI-suggestion input retention, and analytics retention. Do not create speculative real-money, escrow or compensation entities for V1.
